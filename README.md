The purpose of this project, which was made for the International Baccalaureate Personal Project, is to develop a website where you can not only game with each other but also socialize with them, combining the gaming experience with the experience of grabbing a cup of coffee with a mate at a cafe.

## Backstory
The word `Authoria` is defined as `the growing anxiety while completing a story before its fast-approaching deadline`. I picked this name for the project to reflect my concern about finishing it before the deadline, which is rapidly approaching.
